Here are three trends:

## 1) Automation is becoming smarter.

In the beginning, the industrial revolution came for all the farming jobs, and now less than 2% of people in the UK work in farming.  Down from nearly everyone in the feudal ages.  It&#8217;s still reducing, as the chart below shows.  And usually, jobs removed in one sector get replaced by jobs in another sector.<figure id="attachment_60" style="width: 556px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-60" title="Screen shot 2011-09-21 at 23.27.09" src="http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-21-at-23.27.09.png" alt="" width="556" height="254" srcset="http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-21-at-23.27.09.png 556w, http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-21-at-23.27.09-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" />](http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-21-at-23.27.09.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Agricultural Employment over Time</figcaption></figure>

  A Google search does in seconds what a librarian or researcher would have taken months to do.  A &#8220;Computer&#8221; used to be a job title, not the name of a machine.

[They have now built cars which drive themselves](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11508351).  [Cars can already park themselves](http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2006/09/ls_460_parking.html).  This implies that soon delivery drivers, cab drivers, haulage drivers will soon have to go and find something else to do.

## 2) So, labour is becoming smarter.

People spend longer in education now than they ever have.<figure id="attachment_61" style="width: 597px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This implies that low skilled jobs either aren&#8217;t there anymore, or they&#8217;re being offshored to BRICs, or immigration, or fewer permanent jobs.  Unemployment getting higher in Britain.
</p>

## 3) CEOs are Being Paid More, Relatively

There are websites investigating this&#8230;

## Conclusion: A Shift In Fortunes

In feudal Britain, land was the most important resource, and people who owned land were rich.  With the industrial revolution, the balance changed, and capital and the workforce were empowered:  you could make lots of things with machinery instead of land.

The balance of power is shifting away from the workers again, to such an extent that a lot of people aren&#8217;t workers anymore.  The scope of what can be automated is expanding all the time.  This means that fewer and fewer traditional jobs will remain, and capital can replace labour to do these jobs.

Traditionally, whenever technology has displaced labour from one industry, others have appeared to take their place.   For example, call centres were an unthinkable proposition to agrarian society.

Technology increasingly replaces labour wherever there is a process that can be automated: bureacracy or monitoring are good examples.   However it is now moving into areas of where skills were commoditised, and actual presence is not required:  translation, driving, research.

In order to avoid your job being replaced by technology, you need to have a job where:

  1. Presence adds significant value (i.e. you are not just interacting with a machine), or enables the job to be done
  2. You are demonstrating significant variability, flexibility, creativity and autonomy such that the job either can&#8217;t be automated, or the effort of doing so exceeds the reward.

## Underemployment

Here are the big questions:

  1. Are there people now in society who have no skills over and above what can be provided by technology?  At least, skills not valued enough by the economy to make them worth paying for?  What will become of all the taxi drivers and lorry drivers?
  2. How long will it take for technology to catch up with all the people in jobs?  All skills will be automatable eventually.
  3. What happens to the concept of the economy, if the workforce aren&#8217;t working?
  4. What happens to social security?  Will we all be paid to not work?
