Let&#8217;s look at the way humans and natural selection both create evolutionary processes.  Both of these have two key parts:

  * **Permutation:** Creating different versions of an existing successful pattern.
  * **Selection:**  Choosing the patterns that capture the most value, and moving forward with them.

<!--more-->In nature, the first stage, permutation, is done by reproduction, and child-rearing.  This is where a phenotype is effectively creating inexact duplicates of itself.  The second step, selection, is done by the environment, which, through the process of survival-of-the-fittest means that by and large, the phenotypes creating value will live on.

For a business improving a product, things are slightly different, but the process still involves permutation and selection.  The diagram below shows how this works:

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="http://robmoff.at/2012/05/13/157/cg_white/" rel="attachment wp-att-168"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-168 size-large" title="cg_white" src="http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cg_white-590x502.png" alt="" width="590" height="502" srcset="http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cg_white-590x502.png 590w, http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cg_white-300x255.png 300w, http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cg_white.png 648w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a><a href="http://robmoff.at/2012/05/13/157/evo-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-162"><br /> </a>On both sides of the diagram, start at A.  This is an existing product, gene, species, whatever: it&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s going to evolve.  On the left side, it&#8217;s evolving through natural selection, and new permutations are created (0..n of them).  Then, the process of selection occurs to give us B (chosen)&#8230; then the cycle repeats.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  On the right side, we can see how this differs where evolution co-opts a human change agent.  Start with A again.   The first thing the human change agent does is to model A internally.  This is a learning process.  It could mean, understanding how a product works, or how a political system works, or whatever.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The next step is where the human, having built an internal model, then plays with it:  &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be good if&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;What about if it had an extra&#8230;.&#8221;, &#8220;How would it look if we did&#8230;&#8221;.   Each of these is an permutation of the original model, which changes it in a given way.   By mentally performing these permutations, knowingly or not, we identify the deficiencies in A and ways to improve it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Some of these would be terrible ideas.  Our brains do their best to filter these.  Often without us even realising it. Next time you&#8217;re struggling to use a product, you might find that the ways in which it could be improved will just pop into your head, apparently out of nowhere.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I would contend that this has happened because of a process like the one above:  your brain has developed a model of the product, and then iterated around lots of different, incrementally different versions of that same model.  Somewhere else in your brain, the versions that make no sense have been rejected.  The ones that make sense are bubbled up into your conscious brain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In the diagram, these become &#8220;C chosen&#8221; ideas.   The reason your consciousness needs to know about them is that now you need to implement that change, and turn A into B, before you go round again.

  Introducing Value
</h1>

Elsewhere is this blog, we have addressed the concept of [value](http://robmoff.at/2012/05/05/lifeforms-energy-and-value/ "Lifeforms, Resources and Value") with respect to evolution.   Let&#8217;s look again at the two key processes of evolution:

  * **Selection:**  The selection process is a weighing mechanism.  It is basically saying &#8211; does this (species, product, gene, lifeform) add value?  That is, given the resources it consumes, does it get more back by its activities?    Those lifeforms that don&#8217;t manage this, don&#8217;t get selected for further evolution, and they leave the game.
  * **Permutation:**  This is a process in which accumulated value is expended to produce more versions of the lifeform.   The more value a lifeform has produced, the more evolution it gets to do by this approach.

&nbsp;

In a resource-unconstrained universe, only **permutation** would be needed for us to see natural selection working.  We would definitely end up with more fitter lifeforms than unfit ones, because unfit ones would never have collect the resources to permute.

However, we live in a resource-constrained place, so nature conspires to remove the unsucessful lifeforms to make way for newer, more successful ones.

# Behaviour and Value

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Value becomes more complex on the right hand side of the diagram, when we consider how this would need to work for humans (and other behaviour-centric evolving life-forms).  Rather than coming pre-programmed with a set of behaviours, we adapt over time.  This means we need a mechanism of <strong>selection</strong> that doesn&#8217;t involve us dying in order to get us to change our behaviours.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  For this, we have evolved our own value judgement mechanism based on feelings like happiness and sadness.  This sounds like a big leap, but let&#8217;s explore the idea of emotions further and see how this fits in.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://robmoff.at/2012/05/13/157/cg_white-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-178"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-178 size-full" title="Behavioural Evolution" src="http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cg_white1.png" alt="" width="420" height="336" srcset="http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cg_white1.png 420w, http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cg_white1-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In the diagram above, we have a model of behaviours evolving within an ecosystem.   Start at the box on the bottom right:  a creature is exhibiting a behaviour (A) which other creatures can observe and copy.   The permutation process is exactly that &#8211; other creatures observe the behaviour and copy it for themselves, creating A&#8217;.   In the process, the behaviour would be copied inexactly &#8211; no two creatures would do it the same way.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So, other creatures develop their own models of the behaviour, which they can then try out.   And here lies the rub:   Those creatures need to be able to evaluate these behaviours (the selection process) and decide for themselves which ones work and which ones don&#8217;t.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In order to do this, they need an internal value measurement system, which would need to work like this:
</p>

  * I exhibit behaviour A&#8217;
  * I receive a reward (or otherwise)
  * I associate the reward with the behaviour.
  * I evaluate whether this reward-behaviour  causality is worth repeating.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Our brains are attuned to recognise rewards through chemical reinforcers:   when we exhibit a behaviour, and get a reward, somehow, the behaviour itself is rewarded.  This is effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner">Skinnerian</a> operant conditioning.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As well as rewards, we also recognise penalties.   If a behaviour leads us to get hurt, this also generates a stream of emotions, which negatively feeds back on the behaviour.
</p>

<h1 style="text-align: left;">
  On Permutation
</h1>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The <strong>permutation</strong> box in the diagram above conceals a wealth of complexity, though.   The process of rewards and feedback has been well researched over the years (although we still don&#8217;t completely understand all the complexities of the process, or even why it is so complex).  However, the process of mimicry in nature is, if anything, more complex.
