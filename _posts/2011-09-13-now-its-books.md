The Internet Disruption Engine [moves onto books](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/09/death-of-books/).  Amazon sells more [e-books](http://www.fastcompany.com/1754259/amazon-declares-the-e-book-era-has-arrived) than real books.  So what has already occurred in the music industry and the newspaper business is happening in the film industry, happened to the games industry and the rest of the bought software industry now comes to book publishing.

The dynamics of each are different, but the underlying cause is all the same:  IT is revolutionising the media industry big style.

## Music

Music has been changed in two key ways.  Firstly, creating music is no longer expensive.   A bog standard laptop can do today what room full of high tech gear could do ten years ago.   Now you can compose the next number one on the &#8216;plane, rather than in [Richard Branson&#8217;s studio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manor_Studio).

The second key change has obviously been around publication.   Up until CDs, technology served to drive up audio quality.  With CDs, and then with all subsequent changes, it has been about reducing cost and improving convenience.  Now, the marginal cost (i.e. cost to sell a single extra unit) of an online single is practically zero.

## Television

Unlike music, producing television is still very expensive.  We are along way from being able to produce TV shows of discernable quality using a laptop, though advances in technology have reduced the costs at the lower end massively.  If I wanted to publish a podcast of myself talking about fish, that would have little overhead. Making a series of Doctor Who myself will require a budget.

Television publishing is in many ways ahead of the curve.  Most TV is free at the point of consumption, and paid for by advertising.  Much like a google search is.  TV is also evolving from being a temporally fixed broadcast to consume-when-you-want, whether this is via TiVo/Sky+ style recording or downloadable content.    The marginal cost of an extra consumer of television is zero.   The problem that TV is facing is that online advertising is much better targeted than TV advertising.  In order to keep it&#8217;s share of advertising, TV is going to need to know who is watching it, and target adverts to the individual viewer.  Also, you&#8217;re going to need some way of making sure that viewer doesn&#8217;t skip over it.

## What Happens When Marginal Cost is Zero?

Authoring books is as cheap and easy as authoring music (i.e. time and a laptop).  Publishing books is also now as cheap and easy as music (i.e. zero).

But what is the result of this?  Firstly, when you have a product who&#8217;s marginal cost is low, you open yourself up to the possibility of piracy.   The producer takes the risk of the up-front costs of production, but after that pirates could step in and undercut you on any cost you charge to recoup this.

Also, in any of these media, where the cost of production could be zero, you will need to compete with budget offerings produced which have very low production costs, and a glut of low-to-no cost competitors.

This means that in any media business, competing with &#8216;free&#8217; is going to be a real issue, whether the item is free because it was produced by amateurs, or because it&#8217;s free because it&#8217;s been pirated.

## What Will Happen To eBooks?

Clearly, Amazon and Apple are having a field day selling music, ebooks and apps for anything like as much as their physical world equivalents.  It&#8217;s pure profit and this will be eroded away by two forces:  businesses coming into the market to sell the same products as Amazon but for less, and authors/musicians etc. discounting their wares to gain market share over their competitors.

Arguably, this is [already happening with the AppStore](http://techcrunch.com/2009/05/20/report-iphone-applications-are-getting-cheaper/).<figure style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

That took a while to happen in the world of apps, [but this may be happening to eBooks already](http://www.teleread.com/publishing/despite-agency-model-indications-are-that-average-ebook-price-going-down/).

## A Counter Example

Scientific journals seem to exist in a world of their own however.   Scientific papers are published in a journal to gain the attention of the audience of other scientists working within the field.  As [George Monbiot](http://www.monbiot.com/2011/08/29/the-lairds-of-learning/) points out, despite the fact that the internet was invented for the purpose of sharing scientific information, journal publisher monopoly power has actually increased over the years.

There are two differences that allow them to maintain their monopoly while others are losing theirs.  Firstly, appearance in a journal is a mark of achievement.  A lot of the value of a scientist&#8217;s work is in the journals he or she has been published in.  A piece of research posted on the internet by a scientist will attract little attention on its own.    So value is created by the quality control gating of the journal itself.

Secondly, while journals sell to individuals on subscription, a lot of their business is to universities, which are charged extortionate fees.  Because universities are sufficiently few in number, and their libraries are easily accessible, it is easy to see which universities have paid their subscriptions and which haven&#8217;t.  This means that the copyrights on journal articles actually mean much more than they do for other forms of media where policing copyright is nigh on impossible.

Note that journals are available online, if you have paid for the subscription.  Their marginal cost for readers of articles is also zero.  What the universities are paying for is a content filtering process which is recognised in its quality by scientists who wish to appear in it.  Scientists who have their work published in a journal gain credibility through being attached to a brand.

## Money In Publishing

How can it be that a content aggregation service is worth more than the content itself?   It&#8217;s all about branding.  In a world where a lot of content is free (legally or otherwise), and we are literally swimming in choice, good brands stand out like a beacon above everything else.    While we are less willing to pay for data, we are (as usual) happy to pay for time saved.   Recognised brands allow us to save time searching and filtering ourselves.

The Journal Publisher model is one which the Times / Economist and other paywall-publications are now following:  proprietary, edited content supporting a brand which must be subscribed to.  However, because they are generalist publications, they are unable to dominate their markets in the same way as the journal publishers (which make massive monopoly profits).
