<img class="alignright" title="Zombie Librarians" src="http://blogs.rsc-wales.ac.uk/lr/files/2009/01/zombielibrarians.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="338" />The other week I was talking to a guy at [15 Queen Street ](http://www.15queenstreet.org/)who was building a website to allow planners to figure out how much it would cost to run a building.  Who would use this?  Apparently, companies thinking about buying Libraries from councils in the UK.  You enter details of the size of the library, and out pops a number of how much it would cost to run.   It&#8217;s like a ready reckoner before you call in the surveyors.  Once you have bought the library, you are obliged to use it as some kind of &#8220;public space&#8221;, which I expect will mean opening a branch of Starbucks in there.

So, it turns out that there are enough libraries in the UK being sold to make this worth building a website for.  I was slightly shocked and dismayed that our libraries are being jilted by local government.

But then I actually went to the library.

The computers in there were getting lots of use.  No one was reading the books.  A lady came in to look at the copy of &#8220;Good Housekeeping&#8221; and then left again.  The cafe was a disaster.   Only the children&#8217;s area seemed really happening.

## The Squeeze

So is the writing on the wall for the library?  Here are two issues:

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">1.  Everything&#8217;s on the internet</span>

The idea of going to your library to _look something up_ or _check out the reference section_ seems incredibly dated.  For general knowledge, you&#8217;re far better off googling it.   However, as discussed in [Now It&#8217;s Books](k/2011/09/13/now-its-books), if you want high quality scientific research, you (or your library) needs to pay a fortune.  This leaves libraries stuck in the middle &#8211; they clearly can&#8217;t compete with either of these two extremes, and also there&#8217;s a walk involved in getting there.

### 2.  eBooks

The second problem is eBooks.  Or, eEverything if you like.  Libraries are a collection of physical media, and their utility is limited because only one person can read any given book at a time.  The library would have to buy multiple copies in order for lots of people to read the same book at the same time.  This problem doesn&#8217;t exist with digital information: the cost of reproduction is close to nil.

In [Faster Star Wars](/2011/10/10/faster-star-wars/) I argued that the more value generated by a piece of mass media, the faster it&#8217;s price would approach zero.  This is going to be  a real problem for eBooks, and before it&#8217;s a problem for them, it will make libraries redundant.  If you can get a (digital) copy of your own of any given book for a very low sum (approaching zero over time) then the benefits of borrowing from a library diminish.

## The eLibrary

Will we get eLibraries?  Well, it depends what one is.  The &#8216;lending&#8217; part of the library will have to go:  you can&#8217;t lend an ebook effectively, as people can just copy it and then give it back, so any library would have to work on the basis of being a &#8220;giving&#8221; library instead:  you join and get books for free.

Will this happen?  Perhaps.  Just as in the way we have lots of free, open source software available, it&#8217;s likely that one day, rather than publishing a book, you&#8217;ll just put it on the internet for free.   I doubt we would call it a library any more though, it would just be part of the internet.

## What Could Governments Do?

With the money saved from not running libraries, the government should do two things:

1.  eBook Tokens

Simply give people money to spend on eBooks of their choice, at Amazon or wherever.  These would have a face value, allowing people to buy a certain quantity of books each year.   Amazon would be able to claim a fraction of this face value back from the government as profit.  Net result:  hopefully, more people in the UK reading books.

2.  Start Digitising

If you&#8217;re running a library and you have a large collection of local information, then the government should pay some more of it&#8217;s money saved on helping to get that digitised and up on the internet.   Once this is done, you can happily sell the collection knowing that the information within it is preserved for perpetuity.  With any luck, opening up a collection like this will get much more value out of it.

## Upshot

I have fond memories of the library.  Much of my youth was spent traipsing to and from it in order to stay in books, but what I saw in Colchester Library was&#8230; different.   If it had been like the library of my youth, I would be up in arms about saving it.  But the fact that it was so empty, so unloved&#8230; maybe times are just changing.  And libraries are going to need to change with them.  I accept that my views are based on a sample of one library, and it was in Essex.  But hey, there&#8217;s at least one less library we need right there.
