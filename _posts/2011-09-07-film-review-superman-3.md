What this blog needs is more topical film reviews, and so here isn&#8217;t one.  Superman 3 was released in 1983, so it&#8217;s been around the block.  As a child I loved this film, and there was a disastrous afternoon at home once when the extremely-hard-to-operate prerecord facility on our VHS didn&#8217;t work properly and we ended up with about half an hour of the film missing, necessitating a trip down to the video hire shop so we could watch the rest of it.

For kids, there are great bits like when Superman goes bad and moves the Leaning Tower Of Pisa.  And when he loses his powers and has a fight in a bar.  Also, luckily, he doesn&#8217;t resort to time-travelling shenanigans (like in the first one) to get him out of a plot hole.  Even at age 10 that seemed really suspect.

## Two Keys?

Back in 1983, Richard Pryor could easily create a computer that would become sentient, turn people into killer robots, hijack the electric grid and fire missiles at Superman.  People just wouldn&#8217;t buy that anymore.    Time and again, people have been let down by AI research, so that the malevolence we come to expect from the computer is the kind of annoyance that you find on an automated call answering system, or the amount of junk mail we get.

## Creating Robots

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-34 alignright" title="s3robot" src="http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/s3robot-300x127.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="127" srcset="http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/s3robot-300x127.jpg 300w, http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/s3robot.jpg 565w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://robmoff.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/s3robot.jpg)In many ways though, the modern computer could be so much more malevolent:  we&#8217;ve got the internet now, and records about every aspect of our lives have been computerised.  The Superman 3 computer wouldn&#8217;t bother creating robots: it would steal all our credit card details and run up bills, hack our mobile phones, steal our social security information, hack into the Pentagon files and publish them on the internet and give us all the wrong doses of radiation on the hospital scanner.

Except that we don&#8217;t need an evil computer to do those things, they&#8217;ve all already happened.  As well as being a massively connected computer network, the internet connects together such a vast network of miscreants and halfwits that we don&#8217;t actually need an evil AI at all.

When one finally comes along, it can just join the back of the queue.
