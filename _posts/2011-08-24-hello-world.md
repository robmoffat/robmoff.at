Ok, time to resurrect the blog idea.

It&#8217;s long been my intention to start a blog, populated with articles written in 20 minutes or less.  In fact, 20 minutes should easily cover it&#8230; people have short attention spans and the key to writing is to get as many ideas out in a short a space as possible.

So, what&#8217;s this about?  Primarily, an exercise in writing, and seeing who reads it, but also about asking some questions which don&#8217;t seem to get discussed on the internet, at least in the places I look.  Also, I&#8217;m going to try and make regular posts about what is happening with my software company, [Kite9](http://www.kite9.com).

Also, it&#8217;s a place where I can try and get some ideas down about how the world is changing.  It seems to be changing too fast now for me to process it all as it happens, so here I am trying to make sense of it.

Well, here goes.  I expect you&#8217;ve arrived at this page sometime in 2012 and this is still the only blog entry on there.  Just like any great new year&#8217;s resolution.  Made in September.
