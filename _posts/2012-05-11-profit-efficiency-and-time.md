In [Lifeforms, Resources and Value](http://robmoff.at/2012/05/05/lifeforms-energy-and-value/ "Lifeforms, Resources and Value") I looked at the idea that some lifeform, whether a species, society, company or individual must capture value.   That is, they must see a net gain in resources from their activities.   If I am fishing to catch food to live, I must spend less energy and other resources on the act of fishing than I get back from doing it, otherwise it&#8217;s not worth my while.

# Profit

In business, this is called turning a profit.  If I engage in an unprofitable fishing trip, then I end up dipping into any reserves of energy that I might be carrying.   It&#8217;s the same with companies &#8211; if they don&#8217;t make the sales, they will expend their free cash to keep going.

But profit on it&#8217;s own tells us nothing:  if a company is using vast reserves of energy, but only making a slight profit, an economist would say that it is not providing an adequate return on capital employed (ROCE).   This is effectively a measure of the efficiency with which a company or life-form is operating.

# Efficiency

Efficiency has upsides as well as down-sides.  The big upside of efficiency is that it allows you to grow.  An efficient species captures more resources than it&#8217;s competitors.  These resources are spent by a species on growing the population.   The reason that growing your population is a good idea is that it spreads the risk of extinction amongst a larger group, and it also means that you are doing more evolution (each phenotype has a unique genetic code, therefore exploring more genetic possibilities).

So the great thing about being an efficient organism (in comparison to rivals) is that, within a given period of time, you get to evolve faster, and therefore potentially be even more efficient.

There is a downside of efficiency, though.   Usually, efficiency means specialisation: that is, doing a particular job extremely well.  The problem is that the evolutionary landscape changes all the time with the evolution of other new ideas and species.   So while it&#8217;s possible to be extremely efficient at one moment, you can suddenly find the rug swept from under your feet at the next.

Humans are not a very efficient species.  In fact, mammals generally are not.  Being warm-blooded uses up a lot of energy, and having large brains uses up energy too.   Lizards can live in much more inhospitable conditions than us, eating rarely and drinking little.    We have traded genetic efficiency at exploiting a niche for our flexibility to adapt to lots of different conditions.   Arguably, as the pace of evolution has increased, this has become more and more the best strategy &#8211;  it has been better to be able to flexibly adapt to current conditions than to be completely efficient.

So this represents a tradeoff:  efficiency is something to be aimed for, as it gives you more scope to evolve, but at the same time, you need to preserve adaptability to that you can cope with the changing competitive environment.

# Time

Time, as Einstein pointed out, is relative.   On a species level, time can be viewed as a resource required for evolution:  if you don&#8217;t evolve, you will be left behind and out-competed.   However, for an individual in a species, time for evolution translates to time for reproduction, which is fairly much the same thing.

For humanity, there is a great trade-off with lifespan:   longer-lived individuals are much, much better at competing than younger ones.  This is because it takes so long to learn the ropes.   This seems to be irrespective of the actual length of our lives.  As we have grown to live longer, the amount of time we spend in education has risen and risen (see [Getting Cheaper](http://robmoff.at/2011/09/27/getting-cheaper/ "Getting Cheaper")).

But living longer means you are doing less actual genetic evolution &#8211; species with shorter reproductive cycles evolve faster.

Mammals generally, but humans in the extreme have adapted to this tradeoff by looking after their young for long periods.   We tend to have three or four generations alive at a time, with the most able generations caring for the younger ones.  That way, our memes are passed from one generation to the next efficiently and completely.

We have sacrificed a lot of our ability to evolve genetically for ability to evolve memetically.

# Never Enough Of It

Problem is, we&#8217;re not the only ones evolving.  As discussed in [The Human Change Agent](http://robmoff.at/2012/05/04/the-human-change-agent/ "The Human Change Agent"), we are now evolving at a societal, product, or organisational level.  The pace of this evolution is much faster &#8211; our products and organisations are evolving much more quickly than we are.

Because as humans we are caught up in this evolutionary cycle, our perception of time is altered by it.  The race to enter a market might be six months to a year, pushing reforms through parliament to adapt to the changing world might need to be done in months.   Reacting to changes in the markets might need to be done in hours.

This is why a lot of people are so busy now:  we are the change agents of an organisational evolution which is happening so fast that we struggle to keep up.  No wonder our in-boxes are so full.
