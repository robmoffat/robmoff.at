Evolution has come a long way.  In the olden days, it was just really, really painful to watch.  All those enzymes and amino acids mucking about in the primordial soup.   It&#8217;s a wonder we ever got anywhere.

Once DNA came along, things started looking up &#8211; it was the first successful standardization effort that we&#8217;ve seen on Earth.  Suddenly, (by this I mean over millions of years) the genetic code was reduced to a simple alphabet of G, T, A & C &#8211; adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine).   This was like lego for evolution, and meant that bits of genetic codes could cross from one organism to another and move around.   It really sped the whole process up.

This is **meta-evolution:  **the process of evolving itself had changed, and gotten faster.  (the meta-prefix means that this is the evolution of evolution).<!--more-->

Over the millions of years following, evolution carried on getting better: cells and cellular life-forms, multi-cellular  life forms (same cells in different orders makes different organisms), sex as a means of speciation and specialisation, these all helped.  These were all meta-evolutions too.

# Next, Behaviour

Once more complex brains started appearing, evolution suddenly had a new battleground &#8211; behaviour.  By modifying a few genes here and there, the behaviour of an organism could be changed without it necessarily looking any different.  So, exisiting organisms could exploit new ecological niches just by doing things differently.    Behaviours such as building nests, looking after your young, flocking, hiding and hunting are all behavioural adaptations that have stood the test of time.

Even better than that, though, is the behaviour of mimicry.   Develop a sufficiently powerful brain and you can mimic the behaviours of those around you.  Thus, we move to a model in which behaviours (or [memes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme)) can exist within a population, transmitted by mimcry (most likely, learning the behaviours of parents).

Advanced mimicry is learning, and learning brains can adapt to their environments and explore new ecological niches.    While other species have spent their time evolving protractile claws, clever camouflage or fast running speed, humans have gone all out on being learners.

Being good at learning means you&#8217;re great at learning behaviours from others, but also it seems that we have symbolic reasoning abilities enough that we can re-apply ideas learnt in one area to other areas.   In a very hand-waving way, by evolving to be great learners, this has given us the scope to imagine and invent, which are the ways in which we can apply our learning in new situations.

# The Human Change Agent

Per capita imagination and invention is on the rise.  Two hundred years ago, people had other things to worry about like avoiding being eaten, and doing the hunting and gathering.   Early agriculture (which has been [discussed here ](/2011/09/27/getting-cheaper/)) was tremendously labour intensive, so that didn&#8217;t help matters much either.   But, incremental improvements over time in terms of labour-saving devices (such as ploughs first, then motor vehicles, then looms, production lines, robots and so on) have increased the amount of time available to humans to be change agents.

The power of the change agent is greater these days.  New inventions and behaviours propagate a lot more quickly around the planet due to mass media. It is interesting to think of mass media as being a meta-evolution:  it doesn&#8217;t look like it on the surface, but it is a way of much more quickly propagating successful ideas and behaviours around the planet than there was before.

The internet is the evolution of mass-media.  Whereas in the middle-twentieth century, broadcast was expensive and the preserve of the corporation, the internet reduces the cost of broadcast to near-zero.

# Company Man

Lots of low-touch industries are now largely automated:  car-production, data centres, grid computing, soon, even [driving](http://robmoff.at/2011/09/27/getting-cheaper/ "Getting Cheaper").   The two great things about automation are: it does the same thing every time, and, it frees people up to do other things.   This means that a great mega-trend is that people are moving away from the **doing** jobs (following a process for a certain economic outcome) towards jobs of figuring out and then defining what the doing should be.

One hundred years ago when Ford build his cars on the production line, people were cogs in the production machine.   Thirty years ago, the [Lean Manufacturing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) process responds to this by making the human element on the production line responsible too for process improvement.

Nowadays, there are few people even involved in the production process.   Compare this video of the Mercedes line today:



With this of the Ford Line a hundred years ago:



If you look at say 3:56 on the first video, you&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s a serene environment with a bunch of people in white coats just watching what&#8217;s happening.  Compare that to 1:26 in the Ford one where a guy is frantically putting wheels together at an alarming rate of knotts.  I expect he will be doing that job again the next day, and the next day (except he probably retired about 70 years ago at least, if he wasn&#8217;t involved in some tragic industrial accident much earlier).

# Humans are Evolution

For organisations, services or products to change, currently, they need to engage the human as change agent to apply its unique ability to learn, mimic and invent on their behalf.  This is the last big thing that our products, services and organisations can&#8217;t do without us.

If you aren&#8217;t in a job as a change agent, then you&#8217;re likely to be in a job that is &#8220;high-touch&#8221; (such as teaching, care, cleaning) or requires a skill that hasn&#8217;t been automated yet (such as driving, translation, helpdesks).

My advice would be to go for the change agent job (designer, developer, politician, etc.) or, failing that, the high touch job.  If you&#8217;re in a job doing the same thing, day in, day out, then I think your days are numbered.

In a future article, I will look at how products, services and organisations co-opt the human change agent to evolve themselves.
