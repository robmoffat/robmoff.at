All of the lifeforms on our planet consume resources to survive.  A key one is energy &#8211; we all need that to keep moving.  But, we also need vitamins, minerals and whatnot to actually build our bodies with.  We also deploy our resources in order to accumulate more.   For example, an animal going out foraging will use energy doing so, but it hopes to eat enough to make that worthwhile.

If a species expends more resources every day than they bring in, then they&#8217;re history.   Of course, lots of animals like bears and migratory birds have long periods where they expend more than they consume, but they have to &#8220;save up&#8221; before hand &#8211; nature doesn&#8217;t do loans.

So, when a phenotype expends energy on an activity (say, hunting or grazing), it has the expectation that that activity will pay back more energy later.  This is **value,** and it&#8217;s the same concept as we have for spending money &#8211; when we do, we want to get back value.  That is, the benefit we get back from the money spent is greater than the outlay in the first place.

For most species in the world, this is fairly dog-eat-dog:  you&#8217;ve got to protect the energy you&#8217;ve got while grabbing as much energy from everywhere else as possible.   But there are other ways.

# Symbiosis

The pilot fish is a great example of the other way: it is involved in a trade with a shark (ray, whatever):  in return for protection, it keeps the host animal clean.  Both sides expend energy , but both gain more benefit back from the arrangement.  There is a net creation of value.

Symbiosis is what humans do.  In spades.   We&#8217;re not specialists in the same way as pilot fish (i.e. the whole species playing the same game), but we are specialists within-species.  This means that there is a symbiotic relationship between me and the window cleaner.   I give him money to clean my windows because we both get value from this arrangement (he puts dinner on the table, I get my windows cleaned for a lot less effort than I could do it myself).

Thinking about this at the whole-economy level might be quite tricky.  But luckily, it works at every level.   If the world consisted of just two guys, one who was good at fishing, the other who was good at farming, they could both create value by sticking to their individual specialities and swapping some of their produce.  It would work out a lot better than each trying to do a bit of both.

# Value Reframed

Porter&#8217;s [Value Chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain) seminally framed value within the organisation as a function of change in money, but I hope this article goes further to reframe value in terms of life:  a species is successful if it can accumulate resources rather than lose them.  Now, you might argue that the two individuals, above, fishing and farming, don&#8217;t need each other &#8211; if they do their jobs well enough, they are both going to get enough energy and survive.

However, resources are a bit more complex than that &#8211; we don&#8217;t just need energy, we need lots of different nutrients, so eating a balanced diet means you live longer and better.

This is a lot like the [Homo Economicus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus) idea&#8230; of humans as a species specialising and tranding amongst themselves to maximise value, so let&#8217;s just move onto

# Value and Law

The symbiotic approach is engrained in human behaviour and really represents what society is about.   For example, from a value perspective, stealing makes a lot of sense: taking someone else&#8217;s food might take very little energy, but pay big returns.     It happens all over the place in the natural world, and it&#8217;s just what happens.

However, as humans, we frown on this.  In fact, the symbiotic approach is the only approach we condone:  theft is out.  Also, if you sell a product, it should benefit both the buyer and the seller, otherwise it&#8217;s kind of still theft.

What happens if you stray from the path of symbiotic value creation?  The weight of society will bear down on you and impose it&#8217;s own sanctions:  we try and catch thieves, we prosecute people selling rip-off products, we have consumer groups, laws to protect buyers against dishonest sellers, etc. etc. etc.

It obviously gets a bit more complex when a third party loses out.   For example, oil producers generate value for car drivers by making and selling petrol.  However, they damage the environment a bit, which affects everyone and no one is paying for it.  It&#8217;s almost like the buyer and the seller are doing a little bit of stealing from the rest of us each time they make a transaction.

So, the takeaway from this is that you, your service, your product, need to engage in symbiotic value creation to be allowed to operate in society.

But why does society force us to do this?

This might be a tautological question &#8211; it&#8217;s kind of the definition of society in the first place.   So the question might be, why do we have society?  Here is the answer:  the net amount of value created by agents operating within a society is greater than the net amount of value of the same agents operating without the society.

# Society and Value

In the same way as species need to be net value creators, so do societies, otherwise, they&#8217;ll fall apart and people will prefer anarchy.      There are a number of parallels here:

  * Societies are a common set of rules and behaviours, so are species
  * Societies have to be net generators of value, so do species
  * Societies can change and evolve, and so can species.  Although the mechanism to change society is the [Human Change Agent](http://robmoff.at/2012/05/04/the-human-change-agent/ "The Human Change Agent"), not random mutation and natural selection.

One way of looking at society then, is that it is also a type of life form.

So if you wish to exist within it, you need to help society improve it&#8217;s net value, otherwise you&#8217;ll be treated as something hostile&#8230;
