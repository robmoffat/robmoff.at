But people keep on doing it.  Why?

It’s the go-to methodology: build stuff, then test it with humans and then release it.  Problem is, that we get into a situation where it’s not testable, and therefore not releasable.  The reason waterfall is still popular is that it requires the _least up-front investment in anything_.  Literally all the cost of the project is accrued later on.  

Compare with Agile.  Nobody does this right.   Why is that?  One reason is that the practices are _many_ and _hard.  _It’s really impossible to nail down exactly what agile is, what it means.  So, everyone just says they do it, but really, they don’t.  It has up-front costs of understanding the methodology, and writing tests and the planning game, and getting the on-site users.  

But, are people even doing waterfall?   Not PMBOK style waterfall, anyway.  Gathering requirements is _hard_.  Getting people to agree to requirements is hard.  Often these two steps are abbreviated or committed in the waterfall approach.

An observation is that, if a practice has a high up-front cost with a belated pay-off, it will be ignored.  This makes sense on a human level.  We don’t like doing things now that only reward us later on.  This encourages procrastination.

**What is the Problem Then?**

Each approach is bondage-and-discipline, in a different way.  Done correctly, Agile may be the more successful methodology, but it requires more members of the team to adopt the B&D, and you adopt it by changing how you behave _before it pays off._   However, Waterfall catches you later on, at the end, when everything starts to go wrong.

A _humane development methodology_ would not make you do work now for a later pay-off.  It would make you do work now for a pay-off now.  How can we reconfigure waterfall and agile so that this happens?
