Just as _Homo Sapiens_ (humans in tribes, hunting and gathering) evolved into [_Homo Economicus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus) (humans as  a whole ecosystem, using money to decide who exploits which niche), we have evolved again.

We are now _Homo Connectus:  _Humans as one hive-mind organisation, with the knowledge of the entire civilisation available to each of us.
