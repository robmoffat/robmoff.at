When I was a young lad in Felixstowe, the release of Return of the Jedi was a massive event.  We all patiently queued up at the single cinema, paid our money and were duly blown away by Lucas&#8217; amazing space opera.  We then went about collecting figures, and stickers, and lunchboxes and so forth, pouring money into Skywalker ranch.   And we were happy.  Apparently, this happened in May 1983, although I expect by the time Felixstowe got the film, it was more like June or July.

We didn&#8217;t have a VHS player at the time, but apparently in 1986, it was released there &#8211; 3 years later.

I had to wait fully until 1989 to see it again on television.  That&#8217;s six years later.  Six years!

Nowadays, you&#8217;d be unlikely to have to wait more than a few months for a DVD, and maybe a couple of years before it&#8217;s shown on TV.

So what&#8217;s happening there then?

## Erosion of the Paywall

The reason that Star Wars appears on TV sooner now, is that there is no effective way to put a paywall around the film for a long period of time.   Consider how the technology for recording a film has changed:

  1. First, there was human memory.  This is a poor recording medium, but generally means that people don&#8217;t usually go and see a film many times.  Because you have the memory of the film, you don&#8217;t enjoy it as much on subsequent views.
  2. Then, there was the VHS recorder:  if it was on TV, you could record it and keep it.
  3. Then, there was the VHS-to-VHS copier, or you could string together a couple of VHS machines.   This was better still, but quality suffered for each recording.
  4. Then, we had DVD copiers.  Each DVD was just as good as the last one, making it easy to knock off perfect versions of the original film
  5. Then, we had the internet, which meant that there was no need for physical proximity in order to make the copy of the original film.  Distributors have to rush the disc release out before everyone pirates it on the internet.  A single copy leaked (by someone pirating a film reel, or an in-house copy, or simply sitting in the theater with a video camera) to the internet can then be watched by anyone.

So the paywall back in 1983 was constructed of an immense technical barrier (no means to record the film) and a temporal barrier (we&#8217;ll show you the film on TV when we&#8217;ve completely milked the cinema outing).

Nowadays, there is no technical barrier, and the temporal barrier only exists until a bad penny in the corporation puts the master on the internet.

</div>

In any media industry, the same problem applies.  For undifferentiated information which has value to a large audience, the price will tend to zero.  The larger the audience having value from the information, and the better they are equipped technologically, the faster the price will tend to zero.

I can think of only two solutions to the problem:

### 1.  Differentiate your information to the level of individual customers

If you can find a way to provide higher information value to a customer by differentiating the information, go for it.   For example, stock information is free on the internet.  However, information specific to my portfolio of stocks is not available on the internet &#8211; no one else would get any value from it (unless they were up to something underhand).

This is a real problem for mass media &#8211; their model is going to become more and more broken.  However, it might mean that we need to fall back on differentiated media &#8211; for example, going to gigs, the theatre, playing games or interactive internet entertainment.

### 2.  Provide non-information value add.

This might be, for example, access to events, better packaging etc, as this can&#8217;t be reproduced by others.

iTunes provides this through its library interface, and convenience of buying songs.  The value is not in the songs themselves (cos hey, you could easily steal those), but in the convenient way of accessing them.

## Where to Go?

It&#8217;s an interesting thought that George Lucas made more money on selling those figures, lunchboxes (and subsequently DVDs and the new Blu-Ray) than he did the actual cinema releases.

There&#8217;s a strong argument that at some point in the future, it might be that the films are given away, and the latter day Lucas will make all his money from selling the sticker albums.
