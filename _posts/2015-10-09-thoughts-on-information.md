_**Content Aggregators like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, HackerNews, Medium, Google have the power these days, because that’s where the audience is.**_

TL;DR:  Content creators are therefore in a oligopolistic position:  no-one visits websites anymore, they consume on Facebook.  This means that the aggregators have all the power in the relationship, and can set their own arbitrary rules.

**Information likes to be free**
  
****
  
(see** **also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information\_wants\_to\_be\_free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free))
  
****
  
Content creators have no control over the duplication of their information.  And they work in a highly competitive landscape.  Even creators that could set up paywalls therefore suffer piracy (films, music etc) or are substitutable (online magazines).

Conversely, _virality_ occurs because the same information is relevant to a large audience.  We regard vitality as a measure of how many people want to see the information, coupled with the desire to share it.

Content Aggregators therefore make it easy to create and propagate viral information.

**Compare to Kite9** 

Kite9 is also information-based, but the diagrams it produces are relevant only to the people that work on them.  Therefore, Kite9 is not going to suffer from the piracy problem (unless the algorithm is stolen):  people aren’t going to take their paid-for Kite9 diagrams and give them away.  No one else would be interested.

This is _inverse-virality_:  Information likes to be free, yes.  But if it is only interesting to a small group, you can effectively control the audience and create controls around it.

This is also the _value of the content aggregator_:  They provide a tailored, personal feed of information about what your friends are doing, and things that may be of interest to you.  This is inversely-viral too.  And this is why the aggregators have power:  There is no value in you duplicating your feed and publishing it for free on the internet.  The information is free, but _valueless to anyone but you._

_Kickstarter Campaigns_ often work like this:  you add paid-for incentives that personalise the experience in some way.  Even if you are receiving a pure-information experience (say a podcast), having your name in it improves that experience and makes it worth paying for.  
  
__

**Value Of Information**

While information likes to be free, it does have a value nonetheless.  This is why people watch films and pirated films: both have value, one is free.

Content Aggregators try to asses, for each person, the value of the content to that person, to some extent.   On say Facebook, this is done by:

  * Looking at the posts of your friends
  * Suggesting friends based on other friends
  * Looking at your “likes"
  * Looking at what you read and commented on.
  * Looking at what you’ve already seen (and probably excluding it)

 
  
Hacker News, on the other hand works this out by:

  * Number of comments and up-votes
  * Freshness of the article

Twitter does this by:

  * Looking at your “following list"
  * Looking at buzzwords and tags to see how prevalent they are (compared to usual)

All of these algorithms essentially try to establish the _value_ of the information to _you.  _Hacker News asks you to (further) filter based on what you have seen already.  

**Battle Hardening**
  
****
  
Content Aggregators also need to fight against sabotage of their algorithms.  Google used to aggregate by:

  * Web Pages containing your search term
  * How many links to that web page there was on the rest of the internet

They had to drop the latter measure, because it could be _gamed_ by people with an interest in pushing their information. 

**Advertising**

This brings us onto the fact that the consumption of information has value to the reader and the writer.   In our (capitalist) world, lots of people are pushing to us information to sell us things, in the form of advertising.   Advertising is information which, when consumed delivers value to the content creator.  Ideally, it should also deliver value to the consumer:  advertising uses humour or captivating imagery for this purpose, or acts as infotainment, or tries to pass itself off as editorial, to give you the impression that you are being _informed. _
  
__
  
When we accidentally consume an advertisement, we often feel duped or used.  But the same thing isn’t true of a meme like a viral video.  We kind of assume that the video creator isn’t benefiting from us watching the video, so that feels better.  

The feeling of “being duped” is a defence mechanism for us:  we have learnt something from the information, but now we have to correct, and revise that knowledge in the light of the fact that someone has fed us that knowledge _for their own gain._ 

Facebook is constantly making advertising look more like regular content.  Every time they do this, the click-through rate improves, because people are duped without realising.   Also every time they do this, people’s _anti-duping filters_ need to improve, so that they realise that _hey, this is advertising again, watch out!_

**Harmful Content**
  
****
  
Our computers have ways to combat harmful viruses, in the form of software.   Similarly, Meme-viruses have to be benign to some extent to be propagated.  Certain images which _could_ be put on Facebook are deemed _harmful_ or _sick _(torture etc).  These are barred by the network itself:  people actually have the job of checking these images and removing them.  But, this is harmful to those people too.

So we have a matrix here:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      No Financial Benefit To Creator 
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Financial Benefit To Creator
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Cost to Consumer
    </td>
    
    <td>
      “Sick” Content
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Regular Advertising<br /> Advertising via duping.  <br /> Infomercials
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Value and Cost to Consumer
    </td>
    
    <td>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <p>
        Paywalled articles<br /> Newspapers<br /> Magazines 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Books etc. </td> </tr> 
        
        <tr>
          <td>
            Just Value to Consumer
          </td>
          
          <td>
            <p>
              Memes
            </p>
            
            <p>
              News Articles<br /> Sharable Content<br /> Status Updates </td> 
              
              <td>
                <impossible>
              </td></tr> </table> 
              
              <p>
                In reality, items of content don’t fit neatly into one box.  A BuzzFeed or Huffington Post article <i>to some extent</i> advertises that institution.  Memes sometimes have branding.  News articles may deliberately or accidentally give the oxygen of publicity to one institution or other.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Content aggregators actually walk quite a tightrope, because they have to weigh up being beneficial to both the content creators (who will pay for advertising) and the consumers.  So actually, it’s probably not quite the slam dunk that the two linked articles suggest.  Yes, they can create crazy rules that annoy consumers and unfairly penalise individual creators.  But, on the other hand, this is oligopoly:  the aggregators have competition, and they need to deliver comparable value to each other, and the web in general.

                <b>Further Breakdown</b><br /> <b></b><br /> It seems to me that the “Value to the Consumer” square needs to be broken down much further.  HackerNews delivers a very different kind of proposition to Facebook, for example.  A scientific journal, quite another.

                In the human body, we have an immune system that works in two ways:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Defence:   Basically, anti-bodies look for things that are not part of the body and attack them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Immunity:  We detect features of the viruses, and learn to combat them.
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                We have similar systems on computers in the form of virus checkers, spam detectors.   
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In this section, I want to relate the kinds of information systems within our bodies, to the kinds on the internet. 
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Obviously, we want to prevent ourselves from being influenced by harmful information.  <i>Society</i> has some norms about what is considered harmful, and sites like Facebook are <i>obliged</i> to police content according to these principles: nudity, happy-slapping, under-eating, threats and worse are removed from Facebook.<br />  <br /> They are first reported, and then checked and removed, and placed on a blacklist of things that can’t be posted again.  This has obvious parallels to our immune system.

                <b>Curation</b>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                One thing content aggregators do, (from Facebook, to Twitter, to Google) is curation.  There are some subtle things going on with this:   
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Facebook curates based on likes, and a complex algorithm to determine what goes on your front page. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Google also uses keywords.  But, uses likes and other metrics to determine ranking. (Which is essentially curation)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Twitter allows you to view stuff in temporal order.  It doesn’t curate in the traditional sense, but relies on other people to re-tweet some interesting stuff.  Also, you can view in temporal order based on a search-term.  Other people watch for the search term.  The 140 character rule is a leveller.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hacker news has it’s ranking algorithm, based on up-votes, comments, and time-decay.  
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                <b>Ensuring Balance</b>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                One thing you get in the regular, edited news is an effort towards balance.  However, on FB, Google, etc.  there is no effort towards this.  Sites such as HackerNews will essentially tend to publish stuff which is amenable to their readership.  There is a strong bias towards the news that will sell.  
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This obviously happens in newspapers too.  And, we know it happens on Google.  
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The problem is that this is <i>obviously bad</i> if I am consuming news.  The next generation of algorithms needs to fix the balance problem.  
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <b>Wish List</b>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I have a set of interests.  But, I should not just be spoon-fed those interests <br /> Also, I click on link-bait and cat videos.  I shouldn’t just get these.  <br /> I should be <i>somehow</i> given a broadsheet style view of <i>everything that’s going on</i> on the internet.<br /> Twitter is somewhat like this, but perhaps too broad.<br /> Facebook and Hacker News are the opposite of this.<br /> Sometimes I want to read short articles.  Sometimes, long form.<br /> Sometimes, fiction books.  Sometimes, news headlines.<br /> Can I be given a menu of choices?
