When I was 5 years old, I saw a [rag-and-bone man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rag-and-bone_man) riding his horse and cart down our road in New Houghton.  It was the first and last time in the UK that I ever saw a horse being used for anything other than a recreational activity.  But at the start of the 20th Century, horses were used for lots of things: ploughing fields, for transport or war.   Basically, any time you needed some, er, horsepower.

Those days are long gone, and the engine has supplanted them.

Lots of people wonder what will happen to humanity in the 21st Century.   Optimistic futurists say we will evolve into [humanity+](http://humanityplus.org.uk "Humanity Plus"), free of the shackles of our biological lifespan and able to roam the galaxy.  Others see us as relinquished of [our work responsibilities](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/opinion/sunday/douthat-a-world-without-work.html?_r=0 "Post Work Humans"), to be looked after by machines that attend our every need.

Pessimistic futurists worry about the [Rise of the Robots](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2013/05/04/should-we-fear-the-rise-of-the-robots/), [Terminator-style armaggeddon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)), or that the planet will be turned to [grey ooze by nanotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo "Grey Goo").

I have a much more mundane alternative:  Humans will slowly be replaced, exactly like horses were.   Instead of petrol engines slowly accelerating in power and convenience to replace the horse, technology will do the same for the human intellect.   Have a look at this video:

[andrew\_mcafee\_are\_droids\_taking\_our\_jobs.html](http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_mcafee_are_droids_taking_our_jobs.html)

&nbsp;

Andrew McAfee makes a strong argument for the notion that society is improved by technology taking over our jobs.  He says that culture is enriched as technology has improved.   I totally agree.  The problem is, humans will be a decreasing part of this culture.  Our culture was enriched by the invention of the steam and petrol engines, but horses ended up playing much less of  a part in it.   Humans will be required less and less to input into the culture, and, the more they get involved, the more they&#8217;ll be getting in the way.

## Human 2.0?

One argument against this state of affairs is that we will evolve with our technology.  It&#8217;s a nice idea: we already have powerful desktop computers, iPads and smart-phones which augment our own abilities.   After Google Glass, maybe we&#8217;ll have internal implants that improve our cognitive abilities, networking us all together.   Maybe.

Technologies magnify our own abilities, in much the same way as a carriage allows a horse to do a better job of carrying people.    But if something else comes along which can do what we do, but better, it will eventually replace us due to the invisible hand of economic efficiency and the power of competition.   That is:

> A business still running using horses/humans whilst their competition has moved on to cheaper, more efficient engines/computers will have higher overheads, be less profitable and eventually go out of business.

## Humans at Rest?

It would be nice to suppose that our working days might be over, and as a species we can setting down to a life of contented retirement, waited on hand and foot by digital slaves.   For the vast majority of horses, this didn&#8217;t happen.

The horses weren&#8217;t simply put to pasture, and left to reproduce and carry on with their previous, wild existences.  Otherwise, there&#8217;d be a lot more of them around today.  Whilst some are still kept for pleasure, the working horse population has been shrunk massively.

Just because it happened for horses, would it happen for humans?  Let&#8217;s say each person in the UK were given a share in the profits of all (now machine-run) businesses in the UK.   Could they be supported indefinitely, to continue living and reproducing without needing to work?  No.  Again, for economic reasons:

> Businesses supporting a human population would have higher overheads than ones not supporting a population.  They would therefore be less competitively fit, and therefore eventually go out of business, out-competed by more profitable businesses.

## Humans Free To Help?

Once humans are freed of the need to perform the daily grind, couldn&#8217;t they just get on with something else?  This is an economic shift that has happened time and again:  with the invention of the engine, employment moved from being chiefly agricultural to industrial.  With improved automation, employment shifted from the industrial to service and information technology areas.  Won&#8217;t there be another shift?

> I would argue that actually, there _will_ be another shift &#8211; Because machines will get cleverer than us before they get more agile than us, we are likely to have human plumbers and nurses and so on for longer than we will have human fund managers and human programmers.  Once machines are smarter than us, and more agile than us, there aren&#8217;t going to be any new niches we can retreat to.

Just as you don&#8217;t see many horses manning a mobile &#8216;phone shop, or helping out in a call centre, humans won&#8217;t be much use in the society of tomorrow.  Maybe the few that are left could &#8220;do their own thing&#8221; regarded by the future citizens of society as we look at zoo animals today.

Maybe they&#8217;ll just jump on our backs and ride us round for fun every now and again.

## The Parent Trap

Our fate is in a way the same as that of every parent:  to grow older and see your children replace you.  The difference is that this time, it will be our _in silico_ offspring that replace us, rather than our biological ones.  I don&#8217;t want to be replaced at all, but inevitably, one day I will.

Is this the fate we choose, though?  I would be hugely relieved if someone could tell me where my argument is wrong.
