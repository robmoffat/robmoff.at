[Metcalfe&#8217;s law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) (due to Bob Metcalfe, who came up with ethernet, the network your office is probably using) said that any network&#8217;s value is based on the number of users in it.

It&#8217;s a rule that Facebook, Google+, MySpace, LinkedIn and all the others have taken to heart &#8211; the value of their social networks is all about the number of users.

However, it&#8217;s about something else too &#8211; their ability to form a monopoly, wherein they are able to lock in users by providing unique features or making it hard to move to a new network.

Theoretically, Facebook could allow you to be Facebook friends with people on the LinkedIn network.  Or vice versa.  But they don&#8217;t.

If they did, it would create an interesting dynamic:  they would reduce their monopoly power, but increase the size of their network.  It&#8217;s swings and roundabouts.  What you would gain through Metcalfe&#8217;s Law, you would lose from your monopoly.

## Monopoly Profits

That&#8217;s all fine, except that obviously [monopolies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly) are bad for consumers, which is why governments usually do their best to limit their powers.  For example, Facebook seems ok to me, but maybe Google+ is better?  I have no idea, since I have little interest in trying to rebuild my social network in a different system.  Facebook keeps my business because that&#8217;s where everyone else is.

I&#8217;m not that bothered, but I can&#8217;t help but feel that its slightly bizarre that a glorified address book has come to dominate a large part of what should be a utility function of the internet.

So how could these monopolies be curtailed on the social network sites?

Long ago, Google tried to build [Open Social.](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/22/google-plus-opensocial-facebook/)  It was a kind of common language that could work with any social network, and do exactly the kind of other-network friend thing I&#8217;m talking about. Obviously, all of the smaller/dying networks wanted to get involved, as it would increase the value of their networks.  Also obviously, Facebook wasn&#8217;t interested, as it would reduce their monopoly position.

If this had taken off, I guess it wouldn&#8217;t matter if you were on Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ or ran your own social network on a server somewhere. And you&#8217;d be able to move from one provider to another really easily.

But it didn&#8217;t take off, and it&#8217;s kind of obvious that it wouldn&#8217;t.

## Catch

There&#8217;s a Catch 22 situation here:  building a social network is no easy task &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be expensive.  So you need the promise of the monopoly profits in order to make it worthwhile.  So sadly, for the forseeable future, every social network is also going to try and be a social monopoly.

Google+, the newest entrant to the market has turned its back on Open Social, and is basically trying to &#8220;do a Facebook&#8221; over again but with a different name.  That&#8217;s all about maintaining their monopoly on advertising.

Shame on you, Google &#8211; you were right the first time.  If anyone had the resources to break the monopoly and open this thing up, it&#8217;s them.

&#8212;

P.S. In a later article, I will argue that in actual fact this monopoly is unsustainable in anything but the short term.  One day, our address books will be our own again.
