**We should understand the practices and processes being used in the best software projects, and then develop tools that enable those practices and processes for everyone else, without them really having to try.**

Activities need to reward you at the point when you complete them, not way down the road by saving time.

It shouldn’t be about learning new practices, and adopting new ways of working.  Programming is already full enough with gotchas and edge-cases to learn about.  

It should be obvious what to do next.  It might not always be coding.  (_Visibility)_

Most developers aren’t rock-stars.  But, they should be able to get things done too.  Favour simple, obvious tools rather than the most productive ones.

We should be using technology to make our lives easier.  In the same way we set an alarm clock in the morning, we should be able to use software to help us do the right thing.

**How can we automate the right development process?**
