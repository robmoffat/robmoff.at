&#8220;Well, the Nazi&#8217;s were obviously racists,&#8221; explained Oberfeldwebel Jones.  &#8220;I mean, they simply said that everyone who is Jewish was bad.  There&#8217;s no comparison.  What we&#8217;re doing is a rigorous, scientific examination of different types of personality, and then removing the ones that are not productive in the modern world.  You could call it evolution.&#8221;

After this years purges, estimates currently put the number of ISTP personalities down at 1%.  Most of those remaining had left or gone into hiding: locked in cellars until the purge was over.  Was this really progress?

If you looked back, it all seemed quite simple: initially, Myers-Briggs came up with a personality type system.  It caught on in the offices up and down the land, and people used it to examine why it was that they had disagreements with their colleagues.

&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re different personality types!&#8221;  the answer was so helpful.  It explained why people couldn&#8217;t agree, couldn&#8217;t listen, couldn&#8217;t work together.  Then it went further.

Reports came in of companies that deliberately hired certain types of people to get along with the ones they already had, and they used MBTI to do it.  Before long, you had to put your MBTI on your CV.  A bit further down the track and it appeared on the list of recruiter&#8217;s requirements. And there were definitely types that were more in demand than others.

Eventually, some companies realised that they could hire the ISTPs that no-one else wanted, and run a business.  But they started getting a bad reputation, and looking &#8220;unclean&#8221;.

It wasn&#8217;t long before the government stepped in and started setting up camps for unemployed/unemployable ISTPs.  It was mostly the EIFJs that came up with the idea, they were the top dogs now.  But over the last 6 months, with camps full to bursting point, the government had started enacting &#8220;population reduction&#8221; strategies: the final solution.

## Tigers

&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Jones, with his finger pointed at me.  &#8220;If you saw a huge, orange and black striped cat, you might be inclined to stereotype it as a tiger.  Additionally, you might also stereotype all tigers as being likely to kill people if left to their own devices.  Why would you do this?  Self defence.  And you&#8217;d be right to do so.&#8221;

&#8220;The problem in this country is all the ISFP&#8217;s &#8211; the liberals.  They say, just because something is a tiger, doesn&#8217;t mean it wants to eat you.  I say, nonsense.&#8221;

I was having trouble relating this argument.  &#8220;So are you saying stereotypes are good, or bad?&#8221; I asked him.

&#8220;They&#8217;re good, &#8221; was Jones unequivocal reply.  &#8220;They save you from tigers.  They save you from ISTPs.  Where&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;

&#8220;What about Blacks, or Jews, or the French?&#8221; I ask, trying to inject an extra, non-feline dimension into it.  &#8220;People often don&#8217;t like those labels, do they?  I mean, isn&#8217;t it wrong to label someone just so you can attach some stereotypical notions to it?  Aren&#8217;t people a whole lot more complicated than that? &#8221;

&#8220;Well look, &#8221; said Jones.  &#8220;The great thing about MBTI is that we&#8217;re not just basing these classifications on external characteristics like those.  We&#8217;re actually delving into personality here.  That&#8217;s why we have the personality testing.  Really, MBTI is just reflecting back on a person, and showing everyone exactly who they are.&#8221;

&#8220;But what if it&#8217;s wrong? &#8221; I blurted out.  &#8220;There&#8217;s no way to check any of this stuff.  What if these classifications are arbitrary, and maybe don&#8217;t really have that much impact on decision making?  They surely can&#8217;t be telling the whole story.  The brain is massively more complex than a four-dimensional grid.  And what if actually people are meant to be a bit more of a closed book?  Surely making prejudgements of people is wrong, regardless of what they are based on&#8230; I mean, I know everyone does it anyway, it&#8217;s human, but is there any reason to get people doing it more often than they already are?&#8221;

But it was too late.  Jones reached down and opened the drawer in his desk.  He pulled out a folder and handed me a fresh MBTI questionnaire to fill in.

&#8220;I think, &#8221; said Jones.  &#8220;That somehow we had you wrong before.  Lets do another one of these, eh?&#8221;
