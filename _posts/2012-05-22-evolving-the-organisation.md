In [The Human Change Agent](http://robmoff.at/2012/05/04/the-human-change-agent/ "The Human Change Agent"), I looked at the idea meta-evolution, and that evolution itself has evolved by the use of layers of abstraction so that it can do it&#8217;s job faster.   Some mechanisms mentioned were:

  * Chemical evolution
  * Standardized genetic alphabet (i.e. DNA, RNA)
  * Cellular life
  * Multicellular life
  * Behavioural Evolution
  * Societal Evolution

We can see in the above, how nature has evolved layers of _abstraction_ (chemistry is at a low level, behaviour and society at a higher level), used in roughly the same way as software developers do:  we can develop software faster by using the lower level abstractions that came before (e.g building websites uses high-level languages, operating systems, web servers that already exist).

Some of these levels would also (to a software engineer) be called _encapsulation_. For example, a multi-cellular creature encapsulates many millions of individual cells.  A cell encapsulates lots of [organelles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle) (such as mitochondria, plastids, flagella).   A society encapsulates people to a greater or lesser extent.

Then in [Lifeforms, Resources and Value](http://robmoff.at/2012/05/05/lifeforms-energy-and-value/ "Lifeforms, Resources and Value") I considered how evolution was about a constant struggle to capture value, and that societies represented a new type of value-capturing life form.  Through the use of law, they allowed the individuals within the society to capture more value than they could on their own.

Societies,  as they are at a higher level of abstraction and encapsulation than us, evolve faster than we do.  (Consider that humans have been around for about [200,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) years, democracy for [2,500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_democracy) years.

# Living Societies

So, we can see that societies are evolving.  But do they count as a life form?  I would argue that if single-celled bacteria are considered alive, then so should society be:  it has the same self-sustaining and signalling processes as other living things.  Arguably, since it is composed of living, biological entities, it might even count as biological life, but we needn&#8217;t go that far.

If societies are indeed life forms, then they have to face the same evolutionary pressures as other life forms:  they need to capture value (resources) in order to survive, and they are in competition with other societies for the same scarce resources.    Successful societies subsume less successful ones (through wars or annexing, perhaps).  Less successful societies die out: their populations either emigrate or they collapse for some reason.

Here are some ways in which the society life-form is apparent in the everyday world:

  * **Laws are set, and people go to prison:  ** Being in prison is a detriment to the person involved, but a benefit to society as a whole.  Society is happy to pay for the imprisonment.
  * **Most countries have border controls:  ** This is a detriment to every individual, since the individual would rather be allowed to go where he or she wants.  However, society is deemed to gain either by keeping certain people out, or keeping people in, as this preserves the society against change.
  * **Innovation is encouraged:** If I invent a new gizmo that saves everyone time and money, but puts a hundred of people out of work, I am a champion of society.  But, if I kill one hundred people, I would be [one of the worst serial killers ever](http://homesecurity.net/serial-killers/).  Now, obviously, killing people is not the same as putting them out of work, but either way, I&#8217;ve not done them any favours.  But society has gained in the former case and lost in the latter.

# Competing Societies

Different societies have different values, and these reflect the histories and backgrounds of the people within them.  In the UK, we have a strong socialist streak:  we believe in the idea of free healthcare for all, and social security (both introduced after the Second World War).

Is there an evolutionary argument for this?   Perhaps, and perhaps not.  Not all countries in the world share our values.  Some are more socialist, some are less.

I would argue that where a society is more socialist, it focuses more on caring for the constituent humans within itself.  Where it is less socialist, it focuses more on creation of societal value.

For example:  should society care for a terminally sick person?  This is a question for society.  In the UK, we say that yes, society should take on this burden.  Often family will be around to shoulder most of this burden, but if they are not, it will be taken on by social services or healthcare workers.  _To a greater or lesser extent, anyway._

Other societies may feel differently, and adopt a different approach: this is all well and good.  The process of evolution challenges us to explore different **permutations,** after all.   It also enforces a **selection** process:  we don&#8217;t have societies that enforce that everyone over the age of 10 should be executed, for example.  That society wouldn&#8217;t last long and would not generate much value.   We don&#8217;t have Mongol hordes anymore, or Viking raids.  Those ideas have been selected out too.  In fact, traveller communities are being eradicated in the UK &#8211; that&#8217;s a type of society that&#8217;s not really working out anymore.

# Which Societies Survive?

So, what does a society need to do to avoid negative selection?  Clearly, the same thing as any life-form:  be more efficient at generating value than its rivals.   This explains why modern societies encourage innovation &#8211; because this is a powerful tool in efficient value creation.

This also explains why governments are so obsessed with GDP figures:  GDP is a reflection of value creation within a society, and as good a measure of the health of the society-as-life-form as you can get.

So, the socialist dilemma is this:  on the one hand, society should exist to serve the people within it.  But, on the other hand, societies should be trying to capture as much value as possible.  At the moment, this is not much of a dilemma:  Providing healthcare and social security **increases** the overall value creation of the society, because it stops useful people from dying from curable diseases or lack or work.  Additionally, we can see first hand that socialism is obviously a beneficial trait for a society to have &#8211; all societies on the globe exhibit some socialism to a greater or lesser degree.

The real dilemma is in the future.

  But what will happen in the future?
</h1>

If we accept the argument presented in [The Human Change Agent](http://robmoff.at/2012/05/04/the-human-change-agent/ "The Human Change Agent"), then we are expecting that over time, less and less of humanity will be in a position to capture value.  Machines, computers, robots: these things will be better at capturing value than we are.

Eventually, the resources consumed by humans will make them no-longer cost effective:  we will be using up more natural resources than we create for our societies.

What will our societies do then?   If they are in competition with one another, then the societies that decide to ditch humans will out-compete the more benevolent societies that look after their populations.

This is a fairly depressing sounding outcome:  it sounds like we are all doomed.  However, there are two possible ways in which this fate can be avoided, which I will discuss in a future article.
