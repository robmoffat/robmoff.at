Facebook is going IPO.   So what are shareholders actually buying?

When a company has an IPO, do investors expect to get a piece of the company as it was, or as it will be?   IPO&#8217;ing affects the way a company behaves &#8211; it now has to produce financial statements in accordance with the stock market it is listed on.  It also has to think about share price and keeping shareholders happy.<!--more-->

Now, in the case of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg will still control over 50% of the company after the IPO.  This means that, theoretically, he doesn&#8217;t have to keep shareholders happy.  This is probably an illusion.  If he decided that Facebook was going to &#8220;pivot&#8221; and sell online knitwear instead of being a social network, I&#8217;m pretty sure that he would somehow be evicted from the post.

Also, there will be a lot of people within the company looking to maximise the value of the shares they own.

Going IPO is something of a pair of handcuffs:  keeping shareholders happy does matter.  But sadly, shareholders both lack individual vision  (they just want more of the same) and also long term commitment to a company.  This forces you to stick to the knitting (or, er, in this case, not) and look only a year ahead in your forecasts.

So taking Facebook public is a risky business:  on the one hand, you&#8217;re going to stifle evolution within the company.  On the other, you are improving its capital position, which allows it to do things like buying in innovation (Instagram, anyone?).

# Facebook&#8217;s Evolution

So a great question is &#8211; how to evolve Facebook  further?   They have already captured 1 billion people&#8217;s address books, likes, dislikes, comments and photos.  Where would they go from here?     Here are some issues:

## Data likes to be free.

The social graph that they have built up could be anyones after they suffer their first sucessful hack.  What would this mean to another company building a social network, or a product that requires social data?  Also, the privacy concerns this raises really should have given pause already to people just randomly sharing everything about themselves on Facebook.  Maybe we&#8217;ll wake up soon.

## Their big data isn&#8217;t all that big

The amount of current, relevant information they have could probably fit on a few hard disks today.   Adjust for Moore&#8217;s law and it could be on a memory stick in a few year&#8217;s time.

Part of Facebook&#8217;s success has been due to building impressive data centres and handling massive amounts of traffic.  But whereas the amount of data Google is dealing with is growing exponentially, the number of people on the planet is growing at a decelerating rate.  As computing power increases, the effort in building a Facebook infrastructure is going to come right down.

## Market share is captured more and more quickly.

Taking 10 years to get to 1 billion users seems cool now, but in a few years&#8217; time, this will seem slow.  I&#8217;m not saying necessarily that another social network will come along and unseat Facebook, but given that what they have accomplished will seem more and more trivial with time, it&#8217;s likely that a new disruption will appear before long and make Facebook meaningless, in much the same way as no one buys tape-to-tape machines anymore.

So, given these forces, perhaps now is the right time to be cashing out:  today&#8217;s wildly profitable and successful idea is tomorrow&#8217;s turkey, as [Zynga](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/05/decline-and-fall-draw-something/51792/) are just finding out.

In conclusion &#8211; Facebook is a wildly profitable company at the moment, but after IPO, change is going to get harder for them.   When they are no longer solving a &#8220;hard problem&#8221;, they&#8217;re going to get disrupted.
